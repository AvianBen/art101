			<p>Challenges.</br></p>
			<p>I struggled for a bit to figure out what I should Pseudocode, but after some thought I was able to pick some stuff I was familiar enough with to use.</br></p>

			<p>Problems.</br></p>
			<p>I was confused for a bit because my index file in browser was not working properly, </br>but after remembering to save everything and then deleting the link to /...css in my index file everything worked properly.</br></p>

			<p>Results.</br></p>
			<p>The Pseudocode at the top of my page is the results. Here is my Pseudocode for an everday task as well.</br></p>
			<p><br>Making a Sandwich<br>Obtain two slices of bread<br>Put bread on to plate, with the two slices next to each other<br>Obtain mustard and drizzle some on one slice<br>
				Obtain Miracle whip and knife, and use the knife to put some on the other slice<br>Obtain slice of cheese and put it on the left slice<br>Obtain lettuce and put it on the left slice<br>Obtain Meat of choice and put it on the left slice<br>Flip over the right slice on to the left slice, and flip the entire sandwich over<br></p>
