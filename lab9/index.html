				<h1>Challenges.</br></h1>
				<p>One of my main challenges was trying to understand how to correctly append the text I wanted to add to the HTML. <br>It was a bit unclear to me from the instructions but after looking at some documentation I started to understand what I needed to do.</br></p>

				<h1>Problems.</br></h1>
				<p>One problem I had to solve was that I was unsure about which order to use the document elements in. I was able to solve this fairly quickly by double checking the documentation on w3schools. </br></p>

				<h1>Results.</br></h1>
				<p> The results are at the bottom of the page! Everything outputs great now!</br></p>
