				<h1>Challenges.</br></h1>
				<p>It took me a second to realize that we only had to use the console in browser, and that there wasn't a seperate console we had to use.
				</br> Besides from that, the only struggle I faced was remembering to use the semicolons, but after I remembered I didn't forget again.</br></p>

				<h1>Problems.</br></h1>
				<p>The only problem I had was when I was creating the age variable, becuase I thought I was doing it incorrectly because it would show an undefined, but I didn't notice that the result was actually just above the undefined.</br></p>

				<h1>Results.</br></h1>
				<p>Here are the results/execution for the program.</p>
