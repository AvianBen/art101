				<h1>Challenges.</br></h1>
				<p>Our main challenge in this lab was to make sure that our button and input from our js files was able to be connected to our HTML files.</br></p>

				<h1>Problems.</br></h1>
				<p>One main problem I had occured during section when I was trying to do the lab using jquery as one of my classmates suggested.<br> It went well after a bit, but I struggled to rewire my brain to use jquery instead of just the js methods.</br></p>

				<h1>Results.</br></h1>
				<p>In the end, I was able to get the sorting hat method working well as you can see below! </br></p>
