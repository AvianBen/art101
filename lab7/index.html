				<h1>Challenges.</br></h1>
				<p>One of the main challenges was making sure the Javascript file was working correctly.</br></p>

				<h1>Problems.</br></h1>
				<p>I was struggling for a bit becuase I wasn't able to see the Javascript output, but was able to fix it by fixing some minor syntax errors like a forgotten semicolon.</br></p>

				<h1>Results.</br></h1>
				<p>The results are below! It's really cool to be able to see user input changed in a way we have control over.</br></p>
