				<h1>Challenges.</br></h1>
				<p>My main challenge in this lab was mainly for task X. When I was trying to figure out how to make the function work with an array instead, it took quite a bit of time and experimenting to get it right.</br></p>

				<h1>Problems.</br></h1>
				<p>My main problem with this lab was also related to task X. I kept struggling to make the array work with more than 4 pieces, and even though I've made it work with 5, I think a lot of the code could still be improved.</br></p>

				<h1>Results.</br></h1>
				<p>Here are the results/execution for the program.</p>
